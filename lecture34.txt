In this lecture, we walk through the API specification for the Accounts microservice that was designed from the previously defined use case.

We explain how to read and navigate the OpenAPI contract using Swagger Editor, and how requirements are translated into a clean, well-structured API design.

Steps to add a mocking server

Step 1: Install Prism

npm install -g @stoplight/prism-cli

Step 2: Run a Mock Server from your OpenAPI file

In the folder where your YAML is saved:

prism mock account-api.yaml --port 4010 --cors

This starts a mock server on:

http://localhost:4010

Step 3: Expose it to the internet with HTTPS (so Swagger Editor can call it)

Run:

npx cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:4010

It will give you a public HTTPS URL like:

https://mock-lively-hill.trycloudflare.com

Step 4: Add this Mock URL in your servers:
