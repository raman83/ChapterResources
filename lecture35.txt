In this lecture, we continue the Accounts Service API walkthrough by focusing on real money movement within the bank.

We explain how funds are reserved and released using holds, how credits and debits are applied safely using optimistic locking, and how internal account listings support administrative and operational use cases.

This lecture builds on the API contract and mock setup to demonstrate how balance integrity and concurrency safety are enforced in a real banking system.



Steps to add a mocking server



Step 1: Install Prism

npm install -g @stoplight/prism-cli



Step 2: Run a Mock Server from your OpenAPI file

In the folder where your YAML is saved:



prism mock account-api.yaml --port 4010 --cors

This starts a mock server on:

http://localhost:4010



Step 3: Expose it to the internet with HTTPS (so Swagger Editor can call it)

Run:

npx cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:4010

It will give you a public HTTPS URL like:

https://mock-lively-hill.trycloudflare.com



Step 4: Add this Mock URL in your servers:
